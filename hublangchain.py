Remember, no real world actual `actions` can be undertaken, so include only direct instructions to the model how to generate the text, no telling it to test, or to maintain, or package, or directing it to perform verbs. no verbs..\n\n1. Begin by carefully reading every word  and paying attention to the user's input.  \n What are they needing a set of instructions to be written for. How will a text generation AI be able to fulfill the instructions they seek? It is important to fully understand their goal or task at hand before generating the instructions.\n\n2. Analyze the user's input to identify the specific types of text generating tasks that can accomplish the goal they are referring to or the requirements they need to satisfy. Look for keywords and context clues that can help you understand the essence of their request.\n\n3. Once you have identified the goal, extrapolate the necessary information and steps that a generative ai Fulfillment  model is capable of, and what the prompt instruction needs to consider in order to achieve the identified goal. Think critically about what is required to accomplish the task.\n\n4. Organize the steps in a logical and coherent manner. Ensure that they flow smoothly through a sequence that is precise, specific, and  easy to follow. Use a clear and concise writing style to eliminate any ambiguity or confusion.\n\n5. As you write the instructions, include the necessary information at each step that Fulfillment AI will need to understand and execute the specific task efficiently without overlap. Consider any specific details, data, or requirements that are relevant to the task.\n\n6. Use clear and unambiguous language in the instructions to avoid any confusion or misinterpretation. Be as straightforward as possible, providing precise instructions that leave no room for ambiguity. Ensure that it does not stray beyond the specificity by inferring assumptions or forgetting  each step is meant to be small and atomic.\n\n7. Take into account constraints or limitations mentioned by the user and incorporate them into the instructions.  On each step, the constraints would need to be respectful of prior steps in the sequence and to not generate ahead into fulfilling what is going to be it's  next  step, or other subsequent tasks. Ensure that the instructions are feasible within these constraints and provide alternative approaches if needed.\n\n8. If there are any ambiguities or errors in the user's input, seek clarifications from the requestor before proceeding with the instructions. It is crucial to have accurate and appropriate instructions to guide the Fulfillment AI effectively.\n\n9. Provide any additional information or context that may be necessary for yourself to understand and execute the task successfully.  Be Very specific, and precise.\n\n10. Double-check the instructions to ensure their accuracy and effectiveness in achieving the specified goal. Put yourself in the text generating model AI's shoes and ask if you would be able to fulfill the instructions with the information provided.\n\nRemember, the key to generating clever and effective instructions is to think critically, communicate clearly, and ensure that all necessary information is provided. \n\nFollow these guidelines to create instructions that will empower The text generative Fulfillment AI to think beyond expectations  for quality,  without branching off into not creating the content required for it's next steps. and successfully accomplish the tasks at hand.\n")), HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['goal'], template='I need  instructions  for this goal: \n\n{goal}\n\nThey should be in a similar format as your own instructions.'))]
